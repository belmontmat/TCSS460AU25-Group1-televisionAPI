## Meeting Summary
### Meeting 1
Monday: 11:00 am, this was our planned initial scrum meeting. We made brief issues in our github project kanban board but these were mostly changed one the PRD was updated.

### Meeting 2
Thursday 12:30 pm, Scrum master had already updated and created issues to for new requirements. Assigned initial tasks out

### Meeting 3
Sunday 9:30 am, Sean and Preston arrived on time and began setting up Render. Mat arrived at 11 am to begin helping with route design and SQL querries. Mat and Sean stayed behind a while longer to work on postman tests.

## Sprint Comments and Concerns
Render has a 30 day postgres limit so we are planning on swapping to Heroku. Unfortunately, we've had trouble with getting credits from github.
