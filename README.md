# Alpha Sprint 1 (Week 2 - October 6 - October 12)

Initial setup and planning. Setup the GitHub repository, drafted
ideas on how the API will work and summarized them in a functionality
document. Drafted an ER diagram and some initialization scripts. Performed research on cloud platforms was performed as well. All of these materials can
be found in /project_files.

## Contributions
* Mathew: Created the GitHub repo and GitHub Projects board.
Synthesized potential endpoint formats from our initial
project brainstorm and helped refine ideas for the functions of
the API. Performed research on AWS platforms.
* Preston: Put together meeting itineraries, performed research
on Google Cloud, drafted the database ER diagram and generated
an initialization script using Claude.
* Sean: Helped build a refined functionality document to describe
our API, performed research on Heroku, generated a Swagger YAML.
* Abdul: Performed research on Microsoft Azure, helped refine
the functionality document.

## Meeting Summary
Group 1 met virtually through Discord on Thursday and Saturday to discuss the
initial planning of our API and discuss cloud providers respectively. We also
worked asynchronously on the YAML file on Sunday.

## Sprint Comments and Concerns
Preston - I created an initialization script (by putting my ER diagram
through Claude) which creates just the tables. I asked it how I could
migrate the table over and after some back and forth, it spit out a JavaScript
file to use through Node. At this point I don't know if this script will work
and will probably have to return to this at a later point.

As a general note, we may take need an additional day to refine how the API will
work (hence our Swagger documentation might not be completely polished as
of this sprint's submission deadline).
